# Overwatch Counters

Overwatch Counters helps you pick the best heroes to play against an enemy team. When you select your opponents, a list of counters with their counter score will render below. Click on the icon of a counter for the individual matchups between that counter and every member of the enemy team.

All the data is scraped from [OverwatchFire](http://www.owfire.com/overwatch/counters). Votes for each matchup are added and then numbers are normalized so that every hero has a 50% winrate, and counter scores render on a scale from -100 to 100.

You can see it live at [www.overwatchcounters.io](http://www.overwatchcounters.io).
